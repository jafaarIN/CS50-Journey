## Computational Thinking
- Computer science is all about problem solving
- In essence, you break down problems by having an input and a desired output
- Computational thinking entails the approach in which you go about this, i.e, how do you solve the problem of how to find a letter in a string for example.


## Representation
- There are many ways to represent these inputs, outputs:
  There's unary (digits, base1), binary (bits, base2, what computers work off of), ternary (base3), decimal (base10, what we use), and more
  
- Binary consists of 0s and 1s
- The reason why computers use binary, is because of transistors
- Computers contain transistors, switches that can be either on or off. So, the closed transistor would represent 0, opened would represent 1
