# CS50x & CS50 Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This repo documents my journey through Harvardâ€™s CS50x and CS50 Cybersecurity courses.  
My goal is to build a strong foundation in computer science and cybersecurity to prepare for a career in cybersec.

I will be documenting what I learn, with a summary of each lecture.
